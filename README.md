<h1> About me </h1>

I'm 30 years old, only recently decided what I actually do with my life. I did a degree after leaving college in Physical and Environmental Geography but didn't do anything with my degree. 11 years later and still working in retail, I decided that I would like to pursue a career in IT, my goal is to be a software developer. I am now studying for a degree in Computing and IT.
